## はじめに

以前に[A Hierarchical Bayesian Language Model based on Pitman-Yor Processes](/2016/07/26/A_Hierarchical_Bayesian_Language_Model_based_on_Pitman-Yor_Processes/)と[Pitman-Yor過程に基づく可変長n-gram言語モデル](/2016/07/28/Pitman-Yor%E9%81%8E%E7%A8%8B%E3%81%AB%E5%9F%BA%E3%81%A5%E3%81%8F%E5%8F%AF%E5%A4%89%E9%95%B7n-gram%E8%A8%80%E8%AA%9E%E3%83%A2%E3%83%87%E3%83%AB/)の記事を書き、C++でVPYLMとHPYLMを実装しました。

しかしファイルの読み込み処理の書きやすさなどを考えるとPythonの方が便利というのもあり、今回はC++とPythonを連携させPythonからモデルを学習できるようにしました。

## データの前処理

今回は[不思議の国のアリスの原作](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/11/11-h/11-h.htm)を訓練データとします。

単語の区切りを半角スペースで与えます。

ピリオドやコンマなどの記号も一つの単語とみなし、全てスペースで区切りました。

```
‘ Curiouser and curiouser ! ’ cried Alice ( she was so much surprised , 
that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English ) ; 
‘ now I’m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was ! Good-bye , feet ! ’ 
( for when she looked down at her feet , they seemed to be almost out of sight , 
they were getting so far off ) . 
‘ Oh , my poor little feet , I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now , dears ?
```

## HPYLM

まず始めにビルドします。

```
make python_hpylm
```

hpylm.soが作られます。

実行します。

```
python hpylm.py -t alice -n 3
```

`-t`で訓練用のテキストファイルが入っているディレクトリを指定します。

このディレクトリ内のすべてのテキストファイルが読み込まれます。

`-n`でHPYLMのn-gram長を指定します。


## VPYLM

```
make python_vpylm
python vpylm.py -t alice
```

実行結果

" But what am I to get out of a treacle from him to be a grin without a grin , and then the other side of the door — I do , and tried to say . " 
" But what am , it's a very poor hands , and after a few minutes . Alice led into its face . 
" But what am I to get out of the house if it had been broken glass table , but it doesn't matter which she had not attended to this , so that altogether , for her . She did not dare say you’re wondering why , that she was walking hand with the time they had to leave off this minute or two , they all returned from him to you never tasted — " I don't know what they’re about ! Who is , " said the King . 
" I don't know , " she said to herself , " I must be getting home ! " ( a loud , and Alice looked very anxiously fixed on it were nine feet high , and was going to leave off this minute or two , they all crowded round ! " said the King . 
For he can be seen such a curious dream of Wonderland , though , as they would go round her head , she was now about in the last few things being invited , " said the King . 
Soup of the evening , beautiful Soup ! 
Soo — oop of the e — e — evening , 
" But what am I to get hold of anything but it is you hate cats eat bats ? Do you think , " said the King . 
Alice was beginning to think that walk with an M , " and that you weren't to talk about her pet : " why , if I shall sit down upon their faces in their mouths . So they got settled down again , and went on without attending to her : its voice . 
" But what am I to do , and she tried to fancy , that : he came trotting along hand in hand , and Alice was so full effect : " but it had lost : she was to get out of the house down , I should like to be seen them , and she thought there was no one listening , and the Queen .

## おわりに

私の最終目的はPythonでNPYLMを用いた教師なし形態素解析をすることで、HPYLMやVPYLMはその副産物です。

今回は、C++でメインの処理とインターフェースを作りPythonから利用する方法が知りたかったので練習として作成しました。
